# CS210

This repository is for all of my work during CS210.  For each major project, I will be answering the following questions:
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- What did you do particularly well?
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Project 1
This project was to make a clock that outputted both 12 hour and 24 hour clock, and is incremented by user input.  Both clocks are viewed simultaneously.
I felt that my display what I did best on, though I know I could improve upon it.  The menu was formatted in a way that I felt looked fairly clean.
My professor actually mentioned the main thing I need to improve on this.  I had a bug that occured if the minutes rolled over, and the hour was 23 - with the hour not rolling over as it should have.
Making the clock roll over properly was obviously the biggest challenge - as I failed to do so properly.  I did have fun toying with the code to try to fix this though.
A piece of advice I was given that I need to learn to act on better is to not overcomplicate my work.  I need to try to solve the pieces in simpler ways.

Project 2
This project was to make a functional savings and interest calculator based on what amount was put in - both initally and over each month.
Once again, I feel the layout of the output was what I did best on, as it came out looking well organized and clean.
The problem was that the calculations didn't run correctly despite my best efforts.  I need to figure out what caused this issue, and adjust it as necessary.
I found getting the output file to calculate anything was the hardest.  The final product may not calculate correctly, but it did at least do something.  My initial attempts didn't even make it that far.
Though I need to practice more with using them, learning to use header files was the biggest take away from this project.  I need to learn to take better advantage of them.

Project 3
This project was to create a program to read off a grocery list from a .txt file and create a list and histogram with it, and also have the ability to search out individual items and find out how many there are.
I was not able to fully complete this project due to outside circumstances and poor time management on my part.
As I was not able to complete the project, the missing parts would be what need the most improvement - in this case, I need to fix the program's ability to read and output files.
